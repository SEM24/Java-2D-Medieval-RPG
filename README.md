# Inspiration

When I attended IT courses, I was highly motivated to complete tasks with not just 100 percent quality, but 200 percent. 
One day, we received our homework assignment, which involved creating an RPG game in Java console. 
This sparked an idea in my mind: could I develop the same game but with a user interface (UI) instead of just a console interface? 
Since then, it has been one year of development, and I am still making progress.
